# BookMark-Sorter-text-Parser

This java program has a string list. Fill it with your keywords and set the input file name to be your file and this program will generate html files containing all lines with those keywords. Each keyword will correspond to a file. Lines in the input file containing "Paper" (if you have this string in the keyword list) will be put into a file called Paper.html
